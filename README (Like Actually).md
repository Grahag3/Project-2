Known issues:
1. Music and sound effects may start muted, so please navigate to the volume menu before playing. 
2. When a build is created with the gameplay scene included, soething goes wrong. I am not sure why, but I would recommend playing the game from Unity directly, if that was not the initial plan.
3. The Quit buttons only have an effect in builds. I think this is working as intended, but I'm not sure if you wanted something else instead.

I was unable to implement a high score system due to my awful time management skills. I am deeply sorry for this, but I hope the other features are acceptable.
